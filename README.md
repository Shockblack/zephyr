# Zephyr
Zephyr is an exoplanet atmospheric modeling package built in Python using the JAX framework based upon the well vetted ``atmos`` code originally developed by James Kasting, Kevin Zahnle, and David Catling.

>[!CAUTION]
>Zephyr is in the early stages of development and an active work in progress. Any results should be inspected with extreme caution. Please contact Aiden S. Zelakiewicz (asz39@cornell.edu) with any questions regarding the software.
