# Contributing to Zephyr

Thank you for considering contributing to Zephyr; we welcome any contributions to the package with open arms!
Below we have outlined expectations and guidlines for contributing to Zephyr.
If there are any questions, please reach out.


## Getting Started

The first place to look is the GitHub issue tracker, where we place critical items to be developed necessary for the package.
Each item in the issue tracker is designed to be packaged and independent, such that they can be developed in parallel.
Each issue should have a tag identifying the difficulty, necessity, and size of the task
When tackling an item in the issue tracker, please leave a comment so that others know you are working on it.

## Working with the Code

Start by forking the repository (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and cloning the fork to your local system.
You may choose to work in a new branch in your fork, but all eventual pull requests back to the upstream repository must be to the main branch.
While working, be sure to keep your fork up to date with the upstream repository (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

You are encouraged to use automated linting tools while you are editing or writing new code.
An overview of available linting tools can be found here: https://realpython.com/python-code-quality/, although if you do not have a strong reason to use something else, we recommend simply using ruff (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).
